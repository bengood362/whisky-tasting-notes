Distiller:

Nose : Full-bodied, airy. Initially, aromas of apricot and dried fig intermingle with incredibly delicate peat. The aromatic palette evokes a caramelised apricot tart. Superb. Then progresses into notes of orange, prune, roasted mango and dark chocolate.

Palate : Elegant and complex. Powdery (cocoa), finely tarry and covered in wisps of Havana cigar smoke, the flavour profile shows remarkable concentration. Over time, a very attractive malty, indulgent (crème brûlée) and vanilla sequence gives it a beautiful consistency.

Overall : Both firm and smooth. Now, a rather dry, earthy and iodine (seaweed) peat clearly takes centre stage. Entering an increasingly salty world, the retro-olfaction is marked by flavours of smoked fish, seafood (stuffed clams) and also dry straw.
