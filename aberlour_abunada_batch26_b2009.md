#28
Nose: Deep sweet and thick sherry dark fruits (raisin), vanilla, leather, sarsi, brown sugar, oak
Palate: Full-bodied, dark choclate cake, cocoa, raisin, very spicy, become more drying when added water
Finish: Spicy, cocoa, leathery, sweet juicy raisin, drying cocoa

#48
Nose: Sweet sherry dark fruits, plastic, cocoa, leathery, vanilla
Palate: Full-bodied, slightly sweet dark fruits (raisin), vanilla, spicy, hint of tannins, become drying dark fruits vanilla soon
Finish: spicy, very drying, vanilla

When #48 compared to #26:
#48:
Nose: less deeper aroma, less leathery, more vanilla
Palate: less sweet when neat, more sweet when added water
Finish: Astringent dark chocolate but not like cocoa, more drying, more spicy (is it because of open date?)
Verdict:
#26 is more gentle, more cake, fruit-like when compared to #48, while #48 is more vanilla and spicy
