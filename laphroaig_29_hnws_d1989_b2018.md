Nose: Thick but mellow mineral & muddy & farmy peat, citrus, reminds me of longrow with peat more dominating. Very elegant, hay, saltiness
Palate: Sweet vanilla muddily, taste like a bit Caol Ila. Floral, OBE, plums, chocolate, cream soda with no soda, plastic
Finish: Sweet muddy, hint of elegant peat, OBE
Side notes: Drink bigger portion at once
