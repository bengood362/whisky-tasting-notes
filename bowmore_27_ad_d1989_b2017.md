大家好～ Bowmore 27yo 1989 Adelphi 已裝好！ 小弟已試飲，算係偏向鹹香、果香微Soap 走向既 Bowmore。需要頗長時間醒酒，建議唔急住飲可以分開飲2-3次～ 俾足夠時間佢會有陣似 70年代 Bowmore 既熱情果香浮現。 Enjoy 🥃

Style:  Fruity, Smoky and Complex

Nose:
Clean seashore air fuses with aromatic citrus fruits, quite tranquillising. Then we have sushi vinegar, bacon and eggs, bay leaves, seaweed, diesel oil and orange marmalade, while leaving room for a quick spearmint in the middle. Does not remind me too much of Bowmore, but boy, the complexity is over the roof here. Going slightly medicinal now, citrus becomes chimpi, some ginseng roots as well. Sublime lavender floral notes breathing out at the end. Very nice.

Palate:
Stewed tropical and citrus fruits amalgamates seamlessly with the elements of Islay, the sweetness knits tightly together with coal fire barbeque, sea breeze, liquorice roots and some lightly roasted seaweed. Mangoes, yuzu with a delicate but deep umami stroke. Sweet soy sauce, chives, chocolate eclairs and caramel popcorns. Maritime continues to echo throughout, peat smoke and gamey touches are balanced and elevated by a fragrant but subtle lavender jam. Anchovy, malt and white oak towards the end.

Finish:
Tropical and white fruits boiling gently, maritime peat whispers, malt glowing at the back.

Thoughts:
Gosh, the complexity of this dram is incredible, I had plenty of great Bowmores but this one is quite special - the integrations and interactions within the spirit created numerous level of nuances which is simply mind-blowing. Not sure if I can tell this is a Bowmore when served blind (although it feels there is the slightest suggestions of violets on the back palate), which surprisingly, I think it actually enhanced the expression. Very technical, but an excellent dram, a must for whisky connoisseurs. Can argue for a high 2 stars.
